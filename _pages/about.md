Hi! Iâ€™m **Rajashekhar**, a Pre-Doctoral Research Fellow with the [AI Infrastructure group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/ai-infrastructure/) at [Microsoft Research India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/). I am fortunate to collaborate with [Debopam Bhattacherjee](https://bdebopam.github.io/), [Rohan Gandhi](https://rohangandhigen.github.io/), and [Anjaly Prayil](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/aparayil/). My research interests broadly span **systems for machine learning and machine learning for systems**, with an overarching focus on computer systems. I also remain open to exploring new research directions.  

Previously, I was a member of the [Future Generation Lab](https://futuregnetworks.iitdh.ac.in/home) at [IIT Dharwad](https://www.iitdh.ac.in/), where I worked under the supervision of [Koteswararao Kondepu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=X-yZFQkAAAAJ&hl=en). My work focused on problems at the intersection of **networks and systems**, including resource optimization for radio access networks (RAN), energy analysis across RAN generations, and UAV-based communication systems.  

I was also selected as a [Globalink Research Intern](https://www.mitacs.ca/our-programs/globalink-research-internship-students/) through [MITACS](https://www.mitacs.ca/), which gave me the opportunity to conduct research at [Lakehead University](https://www.lakeheadu.ca/), Barrie, Canada, with [Shafiqul Hai](https://lakehead.engineering/people/dr-shafiqul-hai/). There, I worked on the intersection of **FPGA and machine learning**, implementing CNNs on FPGA to achieve ultra-reliable, low-latency, and energy-efficient inference.  

I earned my **B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering** from IIT Dharwad in 2024. Outside of research, I enjoy playing badminton and maintaining a regular fitness routine.
