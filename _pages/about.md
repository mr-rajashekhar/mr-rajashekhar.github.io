Hi! Iâ€™m **Rajashekhar**, a Pre-Doctoral Research Fellow in the [AI Infrastructure group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/ai-infrastructure/) at [Microsoft Research India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/). I am fortunate to collaborate with [Dr. Debopam Bhattacherjee](https://bdebopam.github.io/), [Dr. Rohan Gandhi](https://rohangandhigen.github.io/), and [Dr. Anjaly Prayil](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/aparayil/). My primary research interests lie in systems for ML and ML for systems, with a broader focus on systems. I am also open to exploring new areas.

Previously, I was part of the [Future Generation Lab](https://futuregnetworks.iitdh.ac.in/home) at [IIT Dharwad](https://www.iitdh.ac.in/), where I worked under the guidance of [Dr. Koteswararao Kondepu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=X-yZFQkAAAAJ&hl=en)
 on problems at the intersection of networks and systems. My projects included resource optimization for radio access networks (RAN), energy analysis across RAN generations, and UAV-based communication systems.

I was also selected as a Globalink Research Intern with MITACS, which gave me the opportunity to visit Lakehead University, Barrie, Canada, and work with Dr. Shafiqul Hai. There, I explored the intersection of FPGA and machine learning, implementing CNNs on FPGA for ultra-reliable, low-latency, and energy-efficient inference.

I graduated with a B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Dharwad in 2024. Beyond research, I enjoy playing badminton and working out regularly.
